# Deployment Approach Comparison

## Executive Summary

For the PostgreSQL Branch Manager service, we've prepared three deployment approaches. **Recommendation: Start with Docker Compose**, then migrate to Kubernetes as you scale.

## Detailed Comparison

### 1. Docker Compose on EC2 ⭐ **RECOMMENDED START**

#### Pros
- **Simplicity**: Single YAML file configuration
- **Fast Setup**: Deploy in minutes, not hours
- **Easy Debugging**: Direct container access and logs
- **Cost Effective**: Minimal overhead, runs on single instance
- **Perfect for MVP**: Gets you running quickly

#### Cons  
- **Limited Scalability**: Manual scaling only
- **Single Point of Failure**: No built-in redundancy
- **Manual Load Balancing**: Need external load balancer for HA

#### Best For
- Initial deployment and testing
- Small teams (1-5 developers)
- Services with < 1000 requests/day
- Budget-conscious deployments

#### Setup Time: ~30 minutes

```bash
# Simple deployment
cd docker-compose/production
cp .env.example .env  # Configure variables
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Kubernetes on EC2

#### Pros
- **Production Grade**: Built for enterprise workloads
- **Auto-scaling**: Horizontal and vertical scaling
- **High Availability**: Multi-node redundancy
- **Service Discovery**: Native networking and DNS
- **GitOps Ready**: Perfect for ArgoCD workflows
- **Resource Management**: Efficient resource utilization

#### Cons
- **Complexity**: Steep learning curve
- **Setup Time**: Days to weeks for proper setup
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Cluster updates, monitoring, troubleshooting
- **Cost**: Higher resource usage and complexity

#### Best For
- Production environments
- Multiple services and teams
- Services with > 10,000 requests/day
- Organizations with DevOps expertise

#### Setup Time: ~2-3 days (including cluster setup)

### 3. Hybrid Approach ⭐ **RECOMMENDED SCALE PATH**

#### Strategy
1. **Start**: Docker Compose for branch-manager
2. **Add**: Kubernetes for quotesdb as it grows
3. **Migrate**: Move branch-manager to K8s when needed

#### Benefits
- **Gradual Learning**: Learn K8s with less critical services
- **Risk Mitigation**: Keep working systems working
- **Cost Optimization**: Pay for complexity only when needed

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Docker Compose (Month 1-3)
- Deploy branch-manager with Docker Compose
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Establish operational procedures

### Phase 2: Kubernetes Introduction (Month 3-6)
- Set up K8s cluster
- Deploy quotesdb to K8s for experience
- Implement ArgoCD for GitOps

### Phase 3: Full Kubernetes (Month 6+)
- Migrate branch-manager to K8s
- Implement advanced features (auto-scaling, etc.)
- Optimize and fine-tune

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Docker Compose
- **Minimum**: t3.small (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM)
- **Recommended**: t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)
- **Storage**: 20GB SSD
- **Network**: Single instance with load balancer

### Kubernetes
- **Control Plane**: t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)
- **Worker Nodes**: 2x t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM each)
- **Storage**: EBS volumes with snapshots
- **Network**: VPC with proper security groups

## Cost Analysis (Monthly AWS us-east-1)

| Component | Docker Compose | Kubernetes |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **Instances** | $25 (t3.medium) | $75 (3x t3.medium) |
| **Storage** | $3 (20GB) | $12 (60GB + snapshots) |
| **Load Balancer** | $18 (ALB) | $18 (ALB) |
| **Monitoring** | $0 (self-hosted) | $15 (enhanced) |
| **Total** | **~$46/month** | **~$120/month** |

## Decision Matrix

| Factor | Weight | Docker Compose | Kubernetes |
|--------|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Setup Speed** | High | 9/10 | 4/10 |
| **Operational Complexity** | High | 8/10 | 3/10 |
| **Scalability** | Medium | 3/10 | 9/10 |
| **Cost** | Medium | 9/10 | 5/10 |
| **Future-Proofing** | Low | 4/10 | 9/10 |

**Score: Docker Compose wins for initial deployment**

## Recommendation

### Immediate (Next 30 days)
1. **Deploy with Docker Compose**
2. Set up monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana (included)
3. Implement backup strategies
4. Document operational procedures

### Medium Term (3-6 months)
1. **Evaluate usage patterns** and scaling needs
2. If you need more than 2-3 replicas, **consider K8s migration**
3. Use quotesdb as a K8s learning project

### Long Term (6+ months)
1. **Migrate to Kubernetes** if you have:
   - Multiple services to orchestrate
   - Need for auto-scaling
   - Team comfortable with K8s operations

## Quick Start Guide

Choose your deployment method:

### Option A: Docker Compose
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chad3814/branch-manager-config.git
cd branch-manager-config/docker-compose/production
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
docker-compose up -d
```

### Option B: Kubernetes + ArgoCD
```bash
# Setup cluster first, then:
kubectl apply -f argocd/projects/
kubectl apply -f argocd/applications/
```

Both approaches are production-ready and fully configured!
